# What

A dashboard visualising data from [the Rapture index site](http://www.raptureready.com/). A possible description as follows: "the Rapture index is a Dow Jones Industrial Average of end time activity". The [related wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture_Ready) contains most interesting factoids about the index and the site.

Uses the [Rapture Index CORS API](https://github.com/davidedc/Rapture-index-cors-api) (another project of mine).

# Why

For sure you don't want to miss-out on these vital stats :-)


# How

This is a static website which animates through the data fetched from the [Rapture Index CORS API](https://github.com/davidedc/Rapture-index-cors-api). Since the API uses cors, no further servers are needed, just the static site is OK.
